by Pedro B. Castro
This project is an AI project made with Python, Flask and the Whisper library by Open AI. 

The archive takes recieves a URL for a Youtube video, extracts the audio and transcribes it to text format. 
Install the dependencies by typing 'pip install -r requirements.txt' on your powershell terminal. 
Note: The AI only transcribes videos in English so far, I'm working on transcriibing videos with several languages.
